      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center ">Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>
        At <strong>Voicely</strong>, we value your privacy and emotional safety above all. This platform is designed to allow you to express yourself freely, honestly, and without fear — while respecting the privacy and safety of others.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">1. Account Requirement</h2>
      <p>
        To participate on Voicely, users are required to create an account. However, we keep this process as minimal and private as possible. You will not be asked to share any personal identifying information beyond what is required to create your account (such as a username or email for authentication).
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Minimal Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        Voicely does not request or store your real name, phone number, address, or location. We only collect the essential details needed for account access and platform security. We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third-party advertisers.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Respecting Privacy and Boundaries</h2>
      <p>
        Users are strictly prohibited from sharing anyone else's private or personal information — including names, addresses, phone numbers, photographs without consent, or any content that could reveal someone else's identity or violate their privacy. This includes stories that expose others, exact locations, or sensitive details that can harm or compromise another individual.
      </p>

      <p>
        We strongly encourage users to speak from their own experience and maintain respect and anonymity for others. Violations of this policy may result in content removal or account suspension.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">4. Content Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        While Voicely is anonymous by design, users are still responsible for what they post. Content that includes harassment, hate speech, threats, or the exposure of others’ private lives is strictly forbidden. Our moderation system is designed to maintain a safe, respectful, and healing space for everyone.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">5. Media and Sensitive Content</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to share media (such as images or recordings), ensure it does not contain personally identifiable information or anyone else's image without their permission. All media is moderated, and Voicely reserves the right to remove content that violates user safety or privacy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">6. Analytics and Security</h2>
      <p>
        Voicely may collect anonymized usage data to improve performance, prevent spam, and secure the platform. We do not track your behavior across other websites, and we avoid any third-party tools that compromise user privacy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">7. Updates and Changes</h2>
      <p>
        This policy may be updated from time to time as the platform evolves. Any significant changes will be communicated clearly within the app. Continued use of the platform implies your agreement with the latest version of the privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any concerns or questions about your privacy on Voicely, please reach out to the platform creator, <strong>Sanmith Devadiga</strong>, through official support channels.
